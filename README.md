# Azure-AI OpenAI & AI-Search

## Introduction
This GitHub repo is for code samples of Microsoft Azure-AI Search(Cognitive) & Azure OpenAI services. It demonstrates how to develop Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) based chat-bot by consuming Azure-AI services like OpenAI and Azure-Search(Cognitive). You can refer to code folder of your choice of programminh language - Java, Python(TBD) ot Dot Net(TBD). Please feel free to reach out to me if you find any bugs or have suggesions for improvement. I strongly recommend to read this documentation before you dive into the code. Happy Azure-AI programming.
