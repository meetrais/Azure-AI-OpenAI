# Azure-AI OpenAI & AI-Search

## Introduction
This GitHub repo is for code samples of Microsoft Azure-AI Search(Cognitive) & Azure OpenAI services. It demonstrates how to develop Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) based chat-bot by consuming Azure-AI services like OpenAI and Azure-Search(Cognitive). You can refer to code of your choice Java, Python(TBD) ot Dot Net(TBD). Please feel free to reach out to me if you find any bugs or have suggesions for improvement. I strongly recommend to read this documentation before you dive into the code. Happy Azure-AI programming.
